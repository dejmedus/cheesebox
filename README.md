## ðŸª¤ Cheesebox

Cheesebox is a REPL that (somewhat) understands mathematical expressions written in natural language.

```
Welcome to ðŸª¤
Type ".help" for more

> two plus two
4
> 2/6 teaspoon + 2
2 1/3 tsp
```

Built to experiment with:

- Read-eval-print loops
- [in-line autocompletion](cheesebox/helpers/extended_input.py)
- terminal navigation and history

Uses [readchar](https://github.com/magmax/python-readchar) to capture keystrokes
